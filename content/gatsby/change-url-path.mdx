<Text>When creating themes we can ship with our page paths set, but sometimes we want to give the user the option to change that path. 
    For example, if we had a path that was awesomePage but our theme consumer wanted to change that to myPage, then we can access the 
    users choice via the options they pass into our theme.  </Text>

<Text>In our gatsby-node.js file we can take advantage of the createPages function and access the plugin options. From there we can 
    run a check to see if the user passed in a custom url, if they did we can create that page based off of our original page, thus
    replacing the original pages path. </Text>

<Text>The user consuming our theme would do something like this: </Text>

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        {
        resolve: 'gatsby-theme-boop',
        options: {
          customUrl: 'myPage',

        }
    ]
}
```

<Text>Then in our themes gatsby-config.js file we can accept the option: </Text>

```js
module.exports = (options) => {
    const {
        customUrl
    } = options;
    plugins: [...]
}
```

<Text>Then in our gatsby-node.js file we can use the createPages function and check if the theme consumer passed in the option: </Text>

```js
exports.createPages = async ({ actions: { createPage } }, pluginOptions) => {

    if (pluginOptions.customUrl) {
        createPage({
            path: `/${pluginOptions.customUrl}/`,
            component: require.resolve('./src/templates/awesomePage.js')
        })
    }
  }
```

<Text>The consumer of the theme would then be able to access the page from /myPage instead of /awesomePage </Text>
